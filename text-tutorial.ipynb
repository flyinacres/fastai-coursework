performance of text models on specific tasks by leveraging pre-trained models and transfer learning. Here's the gist of the method:\n\nPre-training: ULMFiT starts with a pre-trained language model on a massive dataset like Wikipedia text. This model learns general language understanding.\n\nGradual Fine-tuning:  Then, ULMFiT fine-tunes the pre-trained model for the target task in stages:\n\nFine-tune the Language Model: The model is further trained on the target task data, but not all parts are adjusted equally.\n\nGradual Unfreezing: Layers closer to the output (more specific knowledge) are adjusted more significantly, while earlier layers (general understanding) are adjusted less to prevent forgetting their core function.\n\nFine-tune the Classifier: Finally, a classifier specific to the target task (e.g., sentiment analysis) is added on top of the fine-tuned language model and trained.\n\nULMFiT's strength lies in its ability to achieve good results even with limited labeled data for the target task, because the model benefits from the pre-trained knowledge.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dls_lm = TextDataLoaders.from_folder(path, is_lm=True, valid_pct=0.1)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dls_lm.show_batch(max_n=5)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

attached to the glam and xxunk that colour the pages of our newspapers and whose xxunk party habits ) we follow with such maniacal fervour which only our intrinsic voyeuristic streak can explain . \\n\\n xxmaj the page 3 phenomenon is as deplorable as it is enigmatic . xxmaj how exactly did it gain such control over the printed word and when did it start to encroach into the front page is subject for another debate . xxmaj bhandarkar cleverly avoids that . xxmaj he is concerned only with the mechanisms of this grotesque existence . xxmaj and in doing that , he pieces together the various elements of this way of life . xxmaj like xxmaj robert xxmaj xxunk xxmaj i 'm not comparing xxmaj bhandarkar to xxmaj altman 's genius ) , xxmaj bhandarkar uses myriad characters to further his motive . xxmaj whether it is a page 3 wannabe xxup nri , the gate - crashers , the newly - rich , an upcoming model , a socialite politician or an erotic novella authoress ; all the characters are introduced with an objective and each of them has a separate character - sketch , even if their parts may be miniscule . xxmaj and therein lays the film 's appeal . \\n\\n xxmaj konkona xxmaj sen xxmaj sharma plays xxmaj madhavi xxmaj sharma , a young and talented journalist who covers page 3 for xxmaj nation xxmaj today . xxmaj initially content with her job , she soon begins to see the ugliness of this underbelly that is covered by its fake and cosmetic xxunk . xxmaj but xxmaj bhandarkar resists the temptation to make this subject into a moral - policing movie and avoids concentrating on one character alone . xxmaj hence the movie is not only about xxmaj madhavi , but also equally about xxmaj deepak xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj madhavi 's editor who passively accepts his role as a cog of a larger machinery , xxmaj anjali xxunk xxmaj xxunk a socialite suffocating from the social pollution , xxunk xxmaj xxunk a homosexual make - up artist and xxmaj madhavi 's roommates xxunk xxmaj xxunk the sassy xxunk and xxunk xxmaj xxunk aspiring actress . xxmaj it seems like an impossible task to assimilate so many xxunk more ) in one story , but full credit to xxmaj nina xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj manoj xxmaj xxunk for penning a tight screenplay . xxmaj the dialogues by xxmaj sanjeev xxmaj datta and xxmaj bhandarkar have been written with great attention to detail . \\n\\n xxmaj any narrative , no matter how good , can fall flat with the lack of genuine performances . xxmaj thankfully , ' page 3 ' brims with actors and not stars . xxmaj konkona goes through her author - backed role with effortless ease . xxmaj ditto xxmaj boman . xxmaj sandhya xxmaj mridul gets the best written part , but almost overdoes it . xxmaj atul xxmaj kulkarni is wasted though with an underwritten character . xxmaj at times , the director seems too keen to incorporate as much as xxunk , homosexuality , etc . ) . xxmaj but the contexts in which they are used do not make them look rushed . \\n\\n xxmaj ultimately , xxmaj bhandarkar 's attempt is to satiate our voyeurism , but he takes it a step further . xxmaj he takes us inside the photographs and exposes us to the gruesome realities of this sect of humanity that strangely seems to be living in a different and remote world . xxmaj these are the same people that indulged in new - year 's revelry while a few hundred kilometers away their fellow countrymen had been ravaged by nature 's ferocity ! xxmaj clever writing , skillfully incorporated songs , able performances and a genuine feeling of sincerity are what make this film worthy in spite of its lack of finesse and poor production values . ' page 3 ' is an optimum way to enter a new year of cinema . \\n\\n - xxmaj abhishek xxmaj xxunk \\n\\n xxmaj rating- xxrep 4 * \\n\\n * xxmaj poor * * xxmaj average xxrep 3 * xxmaj good xxrep 4 * xxmaj very xxmaj good xxrep 5 * xxmaj excellent \\n\\n 29th xxmaj january , 2005\",\n 'pos')"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dls = dsets.dataloaders(bs=64, before_batch=pad_input)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-17T05:30:38.008460Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-17T05:30:38.008855Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-17T05:30:38.066538Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-17T05:30:38.008825Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-17T05:30:38.065339Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":35,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"tfms = [[Tokenizer.from_folder(path), Numericalize], [parent_label, Categorize]]\nfiles = get_text_files(path, folders = ['train', 'test'])\nsplits = GrandparentSplitter(valid_name='test')(files)\ndsets = Datasets(files, tfms, splits=splits)\ndls = dsets.dataloaders(dl_type=SortedDL, before_batch=pad_input)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-02-17T05:31:38.139546Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-02-17T05:31:38.140554Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-02-17T05:31:45.739772Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-02-17T05:31:38.140511Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-02-17T05:31:45.738587Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":36,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Applying the Mid-Level Data API: SiamesePair**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
